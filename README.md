GGeese Studio — Landing Page
Overview

This project explores how an immersive mixed-reality brand can be translated into a web interface. The goal was to communicate brand identity, atmosphere, and spatial depth through a visually driven landing page while maintaining clarity, structure, and responsiveness.

The page was designed and developed using HTML and CSS, with a strong focus on layout hierarchy, layered backgrounds, and section-based storytelling.

Concept & Approach

The design emphasises immersion and flow. Instead of a single static background, the webpage is divided into distinct sections, each with its own visual environment. These transitions help guide the user through the brand narrative, from introduction to credibility, updates, and contact.

Key visual decisions include:

Layered and section-based backgrounds to create depth

Bold display typography paired with clean body text

Strong contrast and colour gradients to support readability

Clear hierarchy to guide attention and interaction

Features

Hero section with immersive background and call-to-action

Co-founders section to establish credibility

Updates section to highlight recent activity

Socials section with branded background and icon layout

Structured footer with navigation, contact details, and branding

Responsive layout for different screen sizes

Technologies Used

HTML5

CSS3

Google Fonts (Montserrat, Jaro)

No frameworks or JavaScript libraries were used; the focus was on layout, styling, and front-end fundamentals.
